**What is it?**

This project has been initiated by the [Pawlowski group](https://genev.unige.ch/research/laboratory/Jan-Pawlowski) at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/en/university/presentation/). Its aim is to bring easy access to state-of-art bioinfirmatic tools to non-specialist and to command-line reluctant for the processing of raw amplicon sequencing data, i.e. DNA metabarcoding, from illumina paired-end FASTQ to an annotated OTU matrix. 

[SLIM](https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM) is a node.js web application providing an easy Graphical User Interface (GUI) to interact with bioinformatic softwares. It simplifies the creation and deployment of a processing pipeline and is accessible within an internet browser over the internet. It is maintened by [Yoann Dufresne](mailto:yoann.dufresne0@gmail.com) and [Tristan Cordier](mailto:tristan.cordier@gmail.com).

The full documentation is available on the [SLIM](https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM) website github repository, as well as on its [WIKI](https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM/wiki)

**Can I try it?**

Yes! This website is intended to give you a demo of the tool's possibilities. The demo server has a reduced processing power  and the upload capacity is **limited to 1 Gb per run**. However, it should allows you to process a full illumina MiSeq run.

To try it, you can either :
- download this [exemple analysis] to check by yourself the files and their required format. 

OR 

- [prepare your own data](https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM#prepare-and-upload-your-data)
- [analyse your own data](https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/SLIM#analyse-your-data)
